introduction: |
  When I was a child, I aspired to be an inventor with a vision of creating useful tools to enhance human life. 
  However, as I delved into the field of information technology, I realized that programming could also fulfill my goals. 
  This discovery marked the beginning of my journey as an engineer.

  I'm constantly brimming with countless ideas, and during my spare time, I bring them to life.
  I develop various open-source projects such as `Android/Kotlin libraries`, `Intellij-based plugins`, `command-line applications`, `Slack bots`, `Telegram bots`, and more.
  While working on these tools, I've had to address various business requirements, which has led me to continuously expand the breadth of my skill set.
  So, in addition to my primary expertise in Android development, I have explored different domains to varying depths.

  My developed tools have now accumulated over `200,000` downloads, allowing me to materialize my expertise and imaginative ideas to assist fellow developers and people alike. 
  I aspire to contribute to making this world a better place through innovation.

            The first company's interview test primarily involved heavy computation using OpenCV, encompassing tasks such as grayscale conversion, binarization, edge detection, contour detection, trigonometric functions, and a two-dimensional coordinate system, among others.

            As shown in the image, it was required to accurately locate the corners of playing cards (even if they were partially obscured or incomplete) and extract the card's face to determine the card's number, subsequently displaying it.

            This is a console application written in C language designed to assist those solving the Eight Queens Puzzle in understanding the solving algorithm. 
            The program displays the chessboard, chessboard indices, queen positions, and queen territories. 
            It includes both manual and automatic modes.

            In manual mode, users can interact with the program via the keyboard to move the cursor, set queens, remove queens, and reset the chessboard as needed. 
            In automatic mode, the program will automatically demonstrate the problem-solving process and find all 92 non-unique solutions to the Eight Queens Puzzle.
